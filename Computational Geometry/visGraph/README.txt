Lab 7 Visibility Graphs and Djikstra's Shortest Path: 

Overview:
Running mouse2 will will generate a blank template that is sensitive to keypress
and mouseclicks. Use mouse click to draw a polygon.
Press s to begin drawing a new polygon. press e to complete the polygon or
click again on the polygon's start point to close it.
Press c to clear drawings. Press b to place a beginning point. Press f and click to
mark an endpoint. Press z to compute the visibility graph from start to endpoint around all
obstacles. The shortest path will be generated by computing a visibility graph
and running Djikstra's on the start node as a source. Press n to reset the animation and m to animate again!

Press P to toggle shortest path after the VG is computed!
