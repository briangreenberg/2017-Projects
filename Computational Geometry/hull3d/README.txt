README for hull3d lab by Brian and Osborn

This program executes a brute force algorithm to compute the convex hull
of a vector of points in a three dimensional space. After computing, it
will draw a mesh of of the 3d convex hull.

To run the program, call hull3d x to generate the hull of x randomly
generated points.

Keypress options:

b - zoom out
f - zoom in
d,u,l,r - translate
c - fill in mesh
q- quit
x,y,z,X,Y,Z - rotations
i - re-initialize random points
o - cycle through test cases!
