Brian Greenberg and Nate Kent – project 1
This project compares and illustrates the predictive accuracy of the different
 classification approaches that we have explored so far in this class. In this
 project, we will use the example dataset (UCI ML ‘Wine’) and run them through
 several different sklearn classification algorithms.
What the code will do…
1.      Load the Wine dataset from url
2.      Run experiments with various classification approaches, including
 slight variations on each algorithm.
3.      Plot and save confidence intervals to model and illustrate the
 predictive accuracies of our models with different variations.
4.      Generate p-values.
5.      Generate confusion matrices for the dataset.
Our classification approaches…
1.      Decision trees, with variations on the max tree depth
2.      Random Forests, with variations on the number of estimators
3.      KPPs, with variations to K
4.      ANNs, with variations to the hidden layers
Files submitted…
1.      A python file that will run non-interactively from the command line. 
All other files included in the submission are generated from running the
 python file.
2.      A set of confidence intervals comparing each of the different
 variations on each of our experiments.
3.      A corresponding set of txt files and p-values.
