Lab 6: Shortest Path with A*

Overview:
Running mouse2 will will generate a blank template that is sensitive to keypress
and mouseclicks. Use mouse click to draw a polygon.
Press s to begin drawing a new polygon. press e to complete the polygon or
click again on the polygon's start point to close it. You can draw multiple polygons.
Press c to clear drawings. Press R and click twice to draw a robot. Press f and click to
mark an endpoint. Press z to compute the shortest path from robot to endpoint around all
obstacles. The shortest path will be generated by computing an occupancy grid and then running
an a* search algorithm w/ Manhattan Distance heuristic. Press m to animate the robot's
path motion across the path. Press n to reset the animation and m to animate again!
