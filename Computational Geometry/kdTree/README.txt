Lab 5: Kdtrees

Overview:
Running kdtree x will randomly generate x 2d points.
Then, it calls an algorithm to build a kdtree with the given points.
Using the kd tree it renders a mondrian-style image using colored panels to represent
the various subdivisions of the tree.

Keypress options:
- Pressing q will quit and close the illustrator.
- Pressing buttons 1-6 will run additional test cases.

Known errors:

There were many segfault errors but I think we have caught all of them!

- Brian Greenberg and Osborn Ongimor
