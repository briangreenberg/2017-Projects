Lab 6: Moving Guard

Overview:
Running mouse2 will generate a blank template that is sensitive to keypress
and mouseclicks. Use mouse click to draw a polygon (clockwise point order).
Press s to begin drawing a new polygon. press e to complete the polygon or
click again on the polygon's start point to close it.
  As long as there is a polygon drawn, clicking will print a message if you
click outside of the polygon. By clicking inside the polygon, the program
will generate a highlighted green visualization of the visible area of the
polygon with respect to the point that was clicked. By pressing m, the point
will begin moving around the inside of the polygon, bouncing in random directions
from the walls. Press w to move the guard one pixel at a time. Press m again to 
turn guard movement off. Press q to quit!

Known errors:
- as of right now, the only error that we know of arises from drawing the
polygon counterclockwise. As long as the polygon is drawn in the right direction
the program should run without issues!
